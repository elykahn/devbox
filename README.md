Devbox
-----

Webdeveloper's need a lot of resources. CMS, frameworks, libraries, docmentation, tools, etc.
Devbox is a webpage that's a collection of all those resources. A developer's toolbox.

Save it as bookmark and have all your tools within one click!

For now, you can see devbox at http://devbox.timseverien.nl/
